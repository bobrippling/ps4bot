follow-on: %s's %d is straight afterwards, so make sure to turn the PS4 off after you are done to show maximum disrespect
follow-on: %s's %d is after yours :japanese_ogre: so the opportunity to do the perfect crime presents itself. Steal the PS4 and blame them
follow-on: %s's %d is straight after yours but don't let that stop you playing. If they want to play that bad, make them fight you for it
follow-on: %s has a game scheduled straight after yours. A moment's silence please, for the scrublords that play %c

follow-on: Lots of games scheduled today. %s has one booked for straight after yours. Be sure to press the kettle's "water filter changed" button to let them know you've finished your session
follow-on: %s is threatening to use the PS4 straight after you. Maybe try stacking some of those chairs in front of the kitchen door to prevent their entrance :+1:
follow-on: Be sure to hide the PS4 controllers, %s has a big game after yours but rumour has it they really wanted to play hide and seek
